Singleton Design Pattern
-------------------------
This concept is acheived by creating new class:
In this class:

	Here only, we have to create objects of other classes
		-- in one place --- only one time	

Use:
----
	To use less memory.
	Restriction of creating objects in many places.


3 things:
========

1. private empty constructor
2. create object of that same class, in a static method
3. create object of required class(configuration reader), in a non-static method

Here,
What is the requirement?
Ans: object of Configuration reader

How will you get object of CR?
Ans: cr is at getCrInstance method in FileReaderManager class


So,
1. FileReaderManager gives the static method 
2. So we need to make getinstance method as static 
3. By calling method getinstance (static) we can get object of FRM
4. Using object FRM, we can call non-static method (getCrInstance)
5. So, getCrInstance will return object of CR.
