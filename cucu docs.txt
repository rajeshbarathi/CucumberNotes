
Project Overview: Cucumber Java Selenium Automation

Purpose:
	The project aims to automate testing for webApplication using the Cucumber framework with Java and Selenium.
	This approach enhances test efficiency, maintainability, and collaboration among team members.

Key Technologies and Tools:

	1. Java: The primary programming language for writing automation scripts, providing versatility and compatibility.
	2. Selenium: Employed for browser automation, allowing seamless interaction with web applications.
	3. Apache POI: Used for handling Excel files, enabling data-driven testing by reading and writing test data.
	4. Extent Reports: Integrated for comprehensive and visually appealing test execution reports, aiding in result analysis.
	5. GitHub: Version control system for collaborative development, facilitating code sharing and tracking changes.
	6. Maven Apache Quickstart 1.4: Used as the project build tool to manage dependencies, build processes, and project configuration.
	7. JUnit: Employed as the testing framework for executing Cucumber scenarios, providing a structured and organized testing approach.

Framework Components:

	- Cucumber: Utilized for behavior-driven development (BDD), promoting collaboration between technical and non-technical team members through plain-text descriptions of software behavior.
	- Page Object Model (POM): Implemented to enhance code maintainability by organizing web elements and related actions within separate page classes.
	- Data-Driven Testing: Leveraging Apache POI for parameterization, allowing the execution of tests with multiple datasets.

Repository Management:

	The project source code is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and enabling collaborative development.
	The repository structure is organized to segregate test scripts, resources, and configuration files.

Build and Execution:
	
	Maven Apache Quickstart 1.4 is used to manage the project's build lifecycle, dependencies, and configurations.
	Test execution is handled through JUnit, ensuring structured and systematic testing.

Let's continue with the document:

3. Prerequisites:

Before setting up the Cucumber Java Selenium project, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Install the latest version of JDK compatible with your project.
- Git: Install Git for cloning the project repository.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.


4. Setup Instructions:

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository:

2. Open the Project in IDE:
   

3. Configure Project:
  
Group ID: It is a unique identifier for a project's group, typically following a reverse domain name pattern.
For example, if your organization's domain is "example.com," your group ID might be something like "com.example."

Artifact ID: It is the name of the specific project or module within the group.
It represents the artifact produced by the project, such as a JAR file. The artifact ID should be unique within the group.

4. Install Dependencies:
   

5. Folder Structure:

Organize your project with the following folder structure:

- src/main/java: Java source code.
- src/test/java: Test-related Java source code.
- src/test/resources: Configuration files and resources.
- src/test/resources/features: Cucumber feature files.
- src/test/resources/drivers: Webdriver executables.
- src/test/resources/config: Configuration files (e.g., properties files).


6. Feature Files:

Cucumber feature files use the Gherkin syntax to describe test scenarios. Example feature file:

gherkin
Feature: Login Functionality

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid username and password
    Then the user should be logged in successfully


7. Step Definitions:

Link Cucumber scenarios with Java code using step definitions. Example step definition:

Java
public class LoginStepDefinitions {

    @Given("the user is on the login page")
    public void navigateToLoginPage() {
        // Implementation
    }

    @When("the user enters valid username and password")
    public void enterCredentials() {
        // Implementation
    }

    @Then("the user should be logged in successfully")
    public void verifyLoginSuccess() {
        // Implementation
    }
}

8. Configuration:

Configure the project using properties files or configuration classes. Example configuration:

Java
public class AppConfig {
    public static final String BASE_URL = "https://example.com";
    public static final String USERNAME = "user123";
    public static final String PASSWORD = "pass456";
}


9. Test Execution:

Execute tests using Maven and JUnit. Run the following command:

bash
mvn test




10. Reporting:

View Extent Reports in the `target/reports` directory after test execution.



11. Troubleshooting:

- Dependency Issues: Ensure Maven dependencies are correctly defined.
- Driver Setup: Verify correct configuration of web driver executables.
- Environment Configuration: Check properties files for accurate configuration.


12. Best Practices:

- Maintain a clear separation of concerns using the Page Object Model.
- Use meaningful names for feature files, scenarios, and step definitions.
- Regularly update dependencies to leverage the latest features and bug fixes.

===================

By organizing common Selenium actions in utility methods, you centralize the logic and make it easier to manage and update.
If you need to make changes to the way clicks or sendKeys are performed,
you only have to update the utility methods rather than searching and updating every occurrence in your code.
This approach adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and helps improve code maintainability.
