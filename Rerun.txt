When we want to rerun in cucumber:
	Create a class in com.adactin.runner as TestRunnerRerun

	In the TestRunner class--> 

				in the features add the---> Adactin.feature (specify the feature file name)
				
				in plugin add "rerun:Report/FailedScenario.txt"

	A FailedScenario.txt file will be created in Report folder.

	In that we'll get the failed scenario details

	
Now in TestRunnerRerun class in features= "@Report/FailedScenario.txt" ---> this is the path of the featurefile in Rerun
	others all same as in TestRunner class

now we can execute the test runner class

We can execute in maven test ---> remove the parallel & fork counts
